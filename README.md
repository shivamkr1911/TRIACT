## 📖 Overview

**TRIACT** is a modern, full-stack inventory and business management platform designed to digitize small retail operations. Unlike static POS systems, TRIACT integrates **Generative AI** and **Computer Vision** to act as an intelligent business partner.

It empowers shop owners to:

- **Chat with their Data:** Ask natural language questions about sales, profit, and employee performance.
- **Predict the Future:** Forecast stockouts days in advance using historical sales velocity.
- **Automate Entry:** Digitize paper invoices instantly using OCR technology.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🧠 Artificial Intelligence Suite

- **RAG Chat Assistant:** Built on **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash**. It uses a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture to fetch real-time database stats (revenue, stock, margins) and provide context-aware business answers in plain English.
- **Stock Forecasting:** A dedicated algorithm analyzes the last 90 days of `Order` data to calculate average daily sales and predict the exact date a product will go out of stock.
- **Smart OCR Scanner:** Powered by **Tesseract.js**. Upload an image of a supplier invoice, and the system automatically extracts item names and quantities to update inventory without manual typing.

### 📊 Comprehensive Dashboard

- **Owner View:** Real-time KPI cards for Revenue, Net Profit, and Units Sold. Includes visual charts for monthly revenue trends and category-wise sales distribution.
- **Low Stock Alerts:** Automated system notifications trigger when product stock dips below defined thresholds.

### ⚡ Point of Sale (POS) & Operations

- **Smart Billing:** Fast, searchable product grid for rapid checkout.
- **PDF Invoicing:** Automatically generates professional PDF invoices using `PDFKit`.
  - **Dev Mode:** Saves locally to filesystem.
  - **Prod Mode:** Uploads to **Vercel Blob** storage for permanent hosting.
- **Employee Management:** Track staff profiles, monthly salaries, and payment status (Paid/Due/Overdue).

## 🏗️ Architecture & Tech Stack

The application follows a **Decoupled Monolith** architecture where the frontend and backend are separate but designed to work seamlessly together.

### Frontend (Client)

- **Framework:** React 18 (Vite Build Tool)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (Utility-first) + Framer Motion (Animations)
- **State Management:** React Context API + Custom Hooks (`useAuth`)
- **HTTP Client:** Axios with Interceptors for JWT handling
- **Visuals:** Chart.js for analytics, Lucide React for iconography

### Backend (Server)

- **Runtime:** Node.js
- **Framework:** Next.js (Pages Router used as API Server)
- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas (Mongoose ODM)
- **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT) with custom middleware (`authMiddleware`, `ownerMiddleware`)
- **AI Engine:** Google Generative AI SDK (`@google/generative-ai`)
